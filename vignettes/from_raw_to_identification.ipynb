    "-   Implement the dynamic theory into the peak matching part, original is 10 ppm as default. Accurate identification relies heavily on MS2 alignment. For low-resolution mass spectrometry, the peak binning method was used, represented by default 1 Da value in Msnbase; While for high-resolution mass spectrometry, the peak matching method was proposed and applied in OrgMassSpecR and msPurity. The peak matching method is usually based on a fixed tolerance, such as 0.25 Da of the default setting in OrgMassSpecR, 0.005 Da for Orbitrap, and 0.015 Da for QTOF. However, a fixed tolerance in the peak matching method may cause misalignment, as the mass resolution will change according to the mz value. In our work, a dynamic mass tolerance was set for peak matching method according to the mass spectrometry types, which is proportional to 〖mz〗\\^2 for FTICR, to 〖mz〗\\^1.5 for Orbitrap, to m/z for Q-TOF and is a constant for Quadrupole mass analyzer, respectively. \n",

    "-   Calculation of Pep score based on the distribution target and decoy dot-product score.\n",

This function take the mass resolving power (MRP) and reference m/z (RefMZ) into consideration to calculate the dynamic peak matching mass tolerance (PMMT). See details in the paper *Improving spectral library search untargeted metabolomics identification by dynamic tolerance peak matching and false discovery estimation*.\n",
    "Now let's start the library search, to save the computational time, here we only used one example with the command of *spectra_meta_q$id[4]*, and used the tictoc package to record the processing time, the total processing time of this library search took 64.3 seconds.
